# Calorie-Counter
IST 256 Final Project

Users will first be provided the option to lookup a particular food's nutritional information. Next, the program will ask users if they want to add calories consumed in any given day. This information must be obtained before proceeding to the Calorie Counter. Once at the Calorie Counter, the program will accept 1 months worth of calories -  4 weeks of input - 7 days per week. The Calorie Counter will display a chart visualization so users can identify what days they are consuming more calories than others (i.e. the weekend). In addition, the Calorie Counter will display average calories consumed per week and total calories consumed per week. The Calorie Counter has set parameters to output to the user, after the user enters a full week of calories, if they are consuming too much or too little. 

Other features that we can include in the program, should it not meet the proper length of the program for the final project, includes: BMI API calculator; weight loss days calculator (manually coded); or ability to export the Calorie Counter to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.
